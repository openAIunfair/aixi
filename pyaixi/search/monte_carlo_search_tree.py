class MonteCarloSearchNode:
    """ A class to represent a node in the Monte Carlo search tree.
        The nodes in the search tree represent simulated actions and percepts
        between an agent following an upper confidence bounds (UCB) policy and a generative
        model of the environment represented by a context tree.

        The purpose of the tree is to determine the expected reward of the
        available actions through sampling. Sampling proceeds several time steps
        into the future according to the size of the agent's horizon.
        (`MC_AIXI_CTW_Agent.horizon`)
 
        The nodes are one of two types (`nodetype_enum`), decision nodes are those
        whose children represent actions from the agent and chance nodes are those
        whose children represent percepts from the environment.

        Each MonteCarloSearchNode maintains several bits of information:

          - The current value of the sampled expected reward
            (`MonteCarloSearchNode.mean`, `MonteCarloSearchNode.expectation`).

          - The number of times the node has been visited during the sampling
            (`MonteCarloSearchNode.visits`).

          - The type of the node (MonteCarloSearchNode.type).

          - The children of the node (`MonteCarloSearchNode.children`).
            The children are stored in a dictionary indexed by action (if
            it is a decision node) or percept (if it is a chance node).

        The `MonteCarloSearchNode.sample` method is used to sample from the current node and
        the `MonteCarloSearchNode.selectAction` method is used to select an action according
        to the UCB policy.
